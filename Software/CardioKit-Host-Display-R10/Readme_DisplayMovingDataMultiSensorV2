Notes for AudioSample playing in processing
	Range is [-1,1]
	use AudioSample.write function to load samples into the array as it is playing
	calling audio = new AudioSample(this, audioBuf, false, CORE_SAMPLE_FREQ) loads audioBuf into the audio object
		it will play from that audioBuf forever after. For continuous playback use a double long audioBuf and do 
		pseudo double-buffering inside of one physical buffer switching writing between the first and second
		half of audioBuf

# CardioKit-AlphaRelease
The public release of these and many more documents is a very active work in progress. The files currently present are enough to manufacture and operate the platform. That said, I am still working on documenting all of my 'institutional knowledge' that I know is just as necessary for making the platform operate as it should. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have an urgent application or desire to collaborate in the meantime.
